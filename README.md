## Learning git at the same time

### Linkedin About us content
For a while, I thought I would be a cook for the rest of my life until I recently find out that I can change my career to something else until I was introduced to software development.

So I didn't waste time and got into it, in my learning so far I have done basic PHP,HTML,CSS and GIT.

I started with PHP as there is a Senior Software Engineer that is willing tutor me whilst learning my first language and PHP is his main language.
So far I have done
- Variables and variable types
- Functions
- Classes and class types
- Objects OOP

Whilst learning PHP, I have done some basic HTML and CSS. I did not go into details as far as CSS is concerned as I will start with laravel framwork soon so, I will be learning one of the CSS frameworks with it. I will come back to learn CSS in detail at a later stage.

I have already started to learn GIT and looking forward to learn Laravel too.
